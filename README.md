This web application is designed to help data engineering teams keep track of the state of their deployments throughout the development environments. The app allows users to add deployments, edit and delete them, enter an assignee, and drag and drop the deployment tasks between the columns labelled by environment. In future versions of this app, I plan to include a login system for security purposes and the ability to filter the board by assignee. \\

The reason I reason I created this app is because I wanted to begin exploring a more efficient and modern way of keeping a deployment log. Currently, in my workplace, we use clucky methods, like a slow running Microsoft Teams area that has been glitchy in the past (not saving the state of certain changes, for example). My app aims to prioritise accessibility, functionality, and speed of use, which is why I have kept the design lightweight and employed the use of asynchronous drag and drop functionalities. \\

To summarise, the app aims to:
- Increase speed of updating deployment log so more time can be spent actually coding/deploying.
- Provide a simple UI with intuitive drag and drop mechanics.
- Keep design lightweight, avoiding the likelihood of glitches as described when using Microsoft Teams method.
- Provide clear status for each deployment and who owns which.
